# Principa Component Analysis
About Dataset
Description:
Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst women in the world. It accounts for 25% of all cancer cases, and affected over 2.1 Million people in 2015 alone. It starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form tumors that can be seen via X-ray or felt as lumps in the breast area.

The key challenges against itâ€™s detection is how to classify tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign(non cancerous). We ask you to complete the analysis of classifying these tumors using machine learning (with principal component analysi) and the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a very commonly used dimensionality reduction algorithm. Unlike factor analysis, PCA does not aim to find common factors, but rather to find results that aggregate information into a small number. Therefore, we need to find a composite variable that can incorporate as much variation (variance) in the original data as possible.

Accuracy was 98.25% and recall was 96.83%, both better than the model using factor analysis.
